## Project Title: Classifier for Spatial Orientation of a Specified 3D Object   

## Project Description:

### Statement of the Problem:

The goal is to train a neural network classifier to identify the spatial orientation of a single prescribed 3D object.    

### Outline of Future Solution:

A small 3D object will be specified in terms of CAD data, for example 3D printer data from [thingiverse.com] (http://www.thingiverse.com).  A data set of 2D images of the object will be generated, assocating the object to its orientation in space.  The images in the data set will include a wide variety of lighting conditions.  An appropriate neural network will be trained with the image dataset.
